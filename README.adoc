= Material for a Math-Precourse for university students.

This repo contains material for a math precourse that I regularly teach
at the University of Applied Sciences in Mannheim, Germany.

The material is intended to be used as a supplement to an existing script
with exercises.

The courses are taught in german, so the material is in german as well.
